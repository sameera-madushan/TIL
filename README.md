This is my personal collection of concise, bite-sized write-ups on things I learn as I explore different tools, technologies, languages, workflows, and interesting developer concepts. Each TIL is a short Markdown note, quick to read, practical to use, and focused on a single concept, command, or idea that helped me understand something better.

This repository is part of my journey of Learning in Public, where I document insights instead of letting them fade away in forgotten tabs or one-off experiments. These are not full-length blog posts, but clear and focused explanations meant to help me (and hopefully you) revisit and understand concepts faster.

If you enjoy this collection or find something useful, feel free to star the repository and share it with others.
